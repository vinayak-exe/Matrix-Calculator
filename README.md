Welcome to my **Matrix Calculator & C Programs** repository! 👋

This repo currently contains:

## 🚀 Matrix Calculator (Work in Progress)

I am building a full **Matrix Calculator in C**. As of now:

* ✔️ **Eigenvalue & Eigenvector calculator** is fully working.
* 🔧 Working on adding:

  * Matrix addition
  * Matrix subtraction
  * Matrix transpose
  * Determinant calculation
  * Inverse (planned)

Stay tuned—more features coming soon!

## 🧑‍💻 Beginner‑Friendly C Programs

This repo also includes simple C programs to help beginners understand:

* Loops & conditionals
* Arrays
* Strings
* Functions
* Basic mathematical operations

## 📈 Intermediate‑Level C Programs

Some slightly advanced programs are also included, such as:

* String manipulation tools
* Searching & sorting logic
* Small utilities
* Pattern programs
